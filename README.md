# HNetPortalM
HNet Web Portal Application
This is a web application I originally wrote in Perl in 2005.  It's been re-written in ASP.net, and added onto over the years.

As a software developer, I've written many various test applications in order to learn new technology, or practice some concepts, etc.  This portal was initially a simple index of these various sites, along with an RSS feed aggregator for viewing some of my favorite news 
sources.   Over time I've made a lot of additions to the app to make it more useful to me.  I have realtime stock market quotes, local 
network monitoring, TFS build status, calendaring, just to name a few.  It uses LDAP to authenticate users (myself and family) against the
household Active Directory domain.

While it is originally a webforms app, I've added an MVC area and a RESTful api in order to keep up with the latest trends.  AJAX, 
Bootstrap 3,and various 3rd party libraries are leveraged as well. 

There is quite a mix of old and new in this code.
